# [Structy](https://www.structy.net/problem-index)

Structy is a platform designed to maximize your understanding of data structure & algorithms by providing a sense of progression and continuity. This is accomplished with a curriculum that balances concept inertia and spaced repetition. The problem sequence of Structy forms a deliberate "course" designed to maximize retention, while minimizing study time.

This repo contains all problem sets and solutions for the course written in Go.
